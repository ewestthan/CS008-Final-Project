            <h2>Ethan West</h2>
            <p>Ethan is a rising junior at the University of Vermont, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Psychology. He grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where his dear mother and father still live. He is an avid rock climber, and spends his days holding on to large rocks and trying to find the easiest way to climb up the hardest part of the boulders. You can also find him jamming along to the Grateful Dead or Pink Floyd on the guitar. </p>

            <h2>Wyatt Taylor</h2>
            <p>Wyatt is a Film and Television student at UVM working to hopefully enter the wider industry and learn more about media as a whole. They’ve had the art world on their mind since they were very young, being raised by a similarly art-minded mother who encouraged them to be creative. This interest in art has helped them create this site for the (fictional) Artem Galleries, and a lot of the selected gallery pieces are from artists they’ve appreciated the work of over the years. Some bonus fun facts: Their family has had two dogs, but they want to eventually get a cat when they get my own apartment, and they’re a big fan of coffee</p>
